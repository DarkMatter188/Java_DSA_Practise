Answer - 1
In Node.js, middleware is a fundamental concept used in web development frameworks like Express.js to handle and process HTTP requests and responses.
Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request and response objects (req and res) and can perform specific tasks in the middle of the request-response cycle.
They can modify the request and response objects, execute additional code, or terminate the request-response cycle early.

Middleware functions are executed in a sequential order, and they can be added to the application's request handling pipeline to perform various tasks such as:

1. Logging: Middleware can log details about incoming requests, response status, and other useful information for debugging and monitoring purposes.

2. Authentication and Authorization: Middleware can check for user authentication or validate access rights before allowing the user to access certain routes or resources.

3. Data Parsing: Middleware can parse incoming data from the request body, query parameters, or headers before passing it to the route handlers.

4. Error Handling: Middleware can handle errors that occur during request processing, such as catching exceptions and sending appropriate error responses.

5. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing): Middleware can handle cross-origin requests and configure the appropriate 
CORS headers to allow or deny access to resources from different domains.

6. Compression: Middleware can compress response data to reduce bandwidth and improve performance.

7. Caching: Middleware can implement caching strategies to store and serve cached responses, reducing the load on the server.

To use middleware in Node.js applications, you typically use a library like Express.js, which provides an easy and flexible way to use middleware.
Middleware functions can be defined and added to the application using `app.use()` or specific HTTP method functions (`app.get()`, `app.post()`, etc.).

Here's a simple example of a middleware function in Express.js:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Custom middleware function
const loggerMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`Received request: ${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next(); // Call next() to pass the request to the next middleware in the pipeline
};

// Add the middleware to the application
app.use(loggerMiddleware);

// Route handler
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, world!');
});

// Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server started on port 3000');
});
```

In this example, the `loggerMiddleware` function logs the incoming request's method and URL and then calls `next()` to pass the request to the next middleware
(in this case, the route handler for the '/' route).
Middleware functions can be chained together to perform multiple tasks in sequence during the request-response cycle.

Overall, middleware in Node.js is a powerful and flexible mechanism that 
allows developers to modularize and enhance the functionality of their applications by inserting custom code at specific stages of the request-response process.

Express is a web framework for Node.js, and it is built on top of Node.js.
Therefore, it's not a matter of using Express over Node.js but rather using Express with Node.js to simplify and streamline web development.
Here are some reasons why developers choose to use Express over building web applications from scratch with only Node.js:

1. **Simplicity and Convenience**: Express provides a simple and straightforward API for building web applications.
It abstracts away many low-level details and common tasks, making it easier and quicker to develop web servers and APIs.

2. **Routing**: Express offers a powerful routing system that allows developers to define routes for different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) 
and URL patterns. This helps organize the application's code and logic more efficiently.

3. **Middleware**: Express has a middleware system that allows developers to easily add custom functionalities to the request-response pipeline.
Middleware functions can be used for tasks such as logging, authentication, data parsing, error handling, and more.

4. **Community and Ecosystem**: Express has a large and active community, 
which means there are many third-party modules and packages available to extend its functionality.
Developers can find pre-built middleware, authentication solutions, database integrations, and more, saving time and effort in development.

5. **Flexibility**: Although Express is opinionated in certain aspects,
it is still flexible enough to allow developers to build applications according to their specific requirements and preferences.

6. **Performance**: Express is built to be lightweight and performant. It is designed to handle a large number of concurrent connections efficiently.

REST (Representational State Transfer) API is an architectural style and set of constraints for designing web services. 
It is a popular and widely used approach for building web APIs that allow different systems to communicate and interact with each other over the internet.

Key principles of RESTful APIs:

1. **Statelessness**: Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.
The server should not store any client state between requests. This simplifies scalability and improves reliability.

2. **Client-Server Architecture**: RESTful APIs follow a client-server model, where the client (e.g., web browser, mobile app) 
and the server (e.g., web server, application server) are separate entities that communicate over the HTTP protocol.

3. **Uniform Interface**: RESTful APIs have a uniform and consistent interface that defines a standard way for clients to interact with the server.
This typically involves using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources.

4. **Resource-Based**: Resources are the fundamental entities exposed by a RESTful API.
Each resource is identified by a unique URL (Uniform Resource Locator), and clients can interact with these resources using standard HTTP methods.

5. **Representation**: Resources can have multiple representations, such as JSON, XML, or HTML. 
Clients can choose the representation they prefer based on the `Accept` header in the HTTP request.

6. **Stateless Communication**: RESTful APIs communicate statelessly, meaning that each request from a client to the server must contain 
all the information needed for the server to understand and process the request. The server does not store any client state between requests, making it more scalable and reliable.

Advantages of RESTful APIs:

1. **Simplicity**: RESTful APIs are relatively simple to understand and implement, making them accessible to a wide range of developers.

2. **Platform Independence**: Since RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods and data formats like JSON, they are platform-independent
and can be accessed from any client or server that supports HTTP.

3. **Scalability**: RESTful APIs can be easily scaled to handle a large number of clients and requests due to their stateless nature.

4. **Flexibility**: RESTful APIs can support multiple data formats and can be used with various programming languages and frameworks.

5. **Caching**: RESTful APIs can take advantage of HTTP caching mechanisms, improving performance and reducing server load.

6. **Security**: RESTful APIs can be secured using standard HTTPS protocols and authentication mechanisms.

RESTful APIs are widely used for building web services that power modern web and mobile applications.
They provide a standardized and interoperable way for different systems to communicate and exchange data over the internet.

Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for Node.js that provides a higher-level abstraction for working with MongoDB.
It is designed to simplify the interaction with MongoDB databases and allows developers to define schemas and models for their data, 
making it easier to work with MongoDB documents in a more structured and organized manner.

Here's how Mongoose relates to MongoDB:

1. **Schema Definition**: In MongoDB, documents are stored in a flexible, schema-less format, allowing each document in a 
collection to have different fields and structures. 
However, in many applications, having a consistent schema for the data is beneficial for data integrity and ease of development.
Mongoose allows you to define schemas for your data, specifying the fields, their data types, default values, validation rules, and more.
This helps in enforcing a consistent structure for documents within a collection.

2. **Modeling Data**: Mongoose provides a way to create models based on the defined schemas.
A model represents a specific MongoDB collection and provides an interface to interact with the data in that collection. By creating models, 
developers can perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the data in a more organized and intuitive way.

3. **Data Validation**: Mongoose includes built-in validation features that allow you to define validation rules for the data.
When you create or update a document using a Mongoose model, it automatically validates the data based on the defined schema,
ensuring that the data conforms to the specified rules before saving it to the database.

4. **Middleware**: Mongoose supports middleware functions, which are functions that can be executed before or after certain operations, 
such as saving a document or removing a document. Middleware provides a way to add custom logic and business rules to data operations.

5. **Population**: Mongoose supports population, which allows you to reference documents from other collections and automatically fetch and populate the 
referenced data when querying. 
This helps in resolving relationships between data and simplifies data retrieval.

6. **Querying**: Mongoose provides a powerful query API that extends the MongoDB query syntax. 
It allows you to build complex queries using chainable methods, making it easier to retrieve data from the database.

Overall, Mongoose acts as an intermediary layer between Node.js and MongoDB, providing additional features and utilities to work with
MongoDB in a more organized and structured manner. It abstracts away some of the complexities of interacting with MongoDB directly 
and offers a more intuitive and user-friendly API for developers to manage and manipulate their data.

To build a server using the `http` module in Node.js with the specified API endpoints, follow these steps:

1. Create a new file named `server.js` and require the `http` module.

2. Use the `http.createServer()` method to create an HTTP server.

3. Implement the logic to handle different API endpoints using the `req.url` property and the `res.writeHead()` and `res.end()` methods.

4. Start the server using the `server.listen()` method.

Here's the complete code for the server:

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  // Set response headers
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');

  // Handle different API endpoints
  if (req.url === '/') {
    // For the root endpoint
    res.writeHead(200);
    res.end(JSON.stringify({ message: 'Welcome to Men & Women Dummy Data' }));
  } else if (req.url === '/men') {
    // For /men endpoint
    res.writeHead(200);
    const menProducts = generateDummyProducts(10, 'men');
    res.end(JSON.stringify(menProducts));
  } else if (req.url === '/women') {
    // For /women endpoint
    res.writeHead(200);
    const womenProducts = generateDummyProducts(10, 'women');
    res.end(JSON.stringify(womenProducts));
  } else {
    // For all other endpoints
    res.writeHead(404);
    res.end(JSON.stringify({ message: 'Page not found' }));
  }
});

// Function to generate dummy products data
function generateDummyProducts(count, category) {
  const products = [];
  for (let i = 1; i <= count; i++) {
    products.push({
      id: i,
      name: `Product ${i}`,
      category: category,
    });
  }
  return products;
}

// Start the server on port 3000
const port = 3000;
server.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

Save the `server.js` file, open your terminal, and run the server using the following command:

```
node server.js
```

Now, your server is up and running, and you can access the API endpoints:

- `http://localhost:3000/` will display the welcome message.
- `http://localhost:3000/men` will send 10 products data of men.
- `http://localhost:3000/women` will send 10 products data of women.
- Any other endpoint will return a "Page not found" message with a 404 status code.
